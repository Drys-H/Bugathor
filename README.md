Bugathor is a simple, text-based quiz game. you play as ‘Pixel Paladin’ on a mission to defeat Bugathor the dragon.  
The game is set in a fantasy world where each question get you deeper into the dungeon. The aim was to create a fun and logic game. 
I choose to set in in text based fantasy to boost engagement. I keep the game play simple and focus du to time management. 
The target players are computer science undergrade first year ( like me ! ) but also game enthusiast and simply anyone who wants to learn CS.

I built this game with Python and Flask for the backend. Frontend is HTML and a little bit of CSS to make it a bit nicer to the eye. The questions are stored on a JSON file. 
The constrains was to include a computer science quiz and to do it in a few hours.
